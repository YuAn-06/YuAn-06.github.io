# &#x26C4; Hi there
 I graduated from [Beijing University of Chemical Technology (BUCT)](https://www.buct.edu.cn/main.htm) with a bachelors'degree, currently pursuing the MA.Eng degrees with the [Engineering Research Center of Intelligent Process Systems Engineering, Ministry of Education](https://cist.buct.edu.cn/8485/list.htm), Beijing University of Chemical Technology, Beijing, China, advised by [Prof. He-Yanlin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Oeav_TkAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). My research interests include process data analytics, soft sensor modeling. I am trying to apply deep learning mechanism into industrial process modeling. 
 
 World is changing consistently, all i wish is to keep myself real and healthy.
